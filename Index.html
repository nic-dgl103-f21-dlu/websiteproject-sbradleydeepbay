          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Bradley Travel and Tours is a small boutique travel agency in
            Shawnigan Lake, B.C., owned and operated by Tara Bradley, a travel
            agent with 25 years of experience. Tara can credit her longevity in
            the industry to one simple thing: she loves making travel dreams
            come true. “I have climbed the Eiffel Tower, floated in a gondola in
            Venice, snuggled a koala, and snorkelled the Great Barrier Reef.
            There are still so many places on my bucket list, and every time I
            help my clients make their own travel dreams a reality, I feel like
            I am travelling too! I love seeing their smiles, and hearing about
            their adventures. It’s important to me that my clients have the best
            possible experience, and I want to share my knowledge and
            experience.”

            “ As an avid world wide traveller, it is very important to me to
            have a travel agent that takes the time to understands my needs and
            wishes. Tara Bradley is that person, she has made herself available
            on my timetable - such as when I called her at midnight from Beijing
            on Good Friday when my flight was cancelled due to weather or when a
            typhoon hit Seoul South Korea and left me stranded in Ulaanbaatar
            Mongolia for 16 hours. Missing my connecting flight, Tara arranged a
            hotel room in Seoul and changed my flight to the next day and it had
            been all arranged before I got there. Her service and commitment are
            unmatched." Ray M.

            "We have worked with Tara for several years now and she has put
            together a number of our bucket list trips. She is friendly and very
            easy to work with, but just as important to me is her reliability.
            Tara's connections in the travel industry are invaluable in sourcing
            the various pieces of our travel puzzle. Our close relationship
            allows her to anticipate our needs and she is very communicative as
            we work out the finer points of our travels. When a MAJOR weather
            event disrupted our plans while we were travelling in Australia Tara
            was instrumental in finding and implementing a solution that
            minimized the impact on us. We look forward to many more adventures
            around the world and wouldn't think of planning them without Tara's
            professional assistance." Matt and Gayle L.
